Module 14 Challenge 

## Background
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

##
The horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 OTUs found depending on the selection in the dropdown menu. The graph is represented by the sample_values vs otu_ids.
The otu_labels are displayed when you hovertext for the bar chart.

The bubble chart represents the otu_ids vs sample_values, also showing the results depending on the dropdown menu subject.
The otu_labels are displayed when you hovertext for the bubble chart.

The demographic information panel updates whenever a new Subject ID is selected.
